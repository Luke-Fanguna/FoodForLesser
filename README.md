	The project that we propose is to help aid students with budgeting and purchasing groceries. The project will be called “FoodForLesser”, which will have the user spend less on their desired groceries. This will start with a grocery list and then the items on the list will be assigned to different stores based on the prices. For example, if the user has milk on their list, we will compare prices and then choose the grocery store with the lowest price. If Vons has milk for $5 and Trader Joes has milk for $4, the milk will then be assigned to Trader Joes due to the lower price.
